# Pig Game Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Python game "Pig." This game has a slight twist: the goal is to be the first player to score 51 points. In Pig, players take turns rolling a die, trying to accumulate points while avoiding the dreaded number one.

## Game Objective

The main objective of the Pig game is to be the first player to achieve a score of 51 points. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die, attempting to accumulate points for their turn. But beware, rolling a one will wipe out all your points for that turn!

## Rules

1. The game begins with both players' scores set at zero.

2. Players take turns rolling a die to accumulate points.

3. After each roll:
   - If a player rolls a one, all points earned during that turn are lost, and their turn ends.
   - If the player rolls any other number, that number is added to their turn total, and they can choose to roll again or save their points.

4. Players can decide to "save" their current turn's points by selecting the "Save" option. The points are added to their total score, and it becomes the other player's turn.

5. The game continues with players taking alternating turns.

6. The first player to reach or exceed 51 points wins the game.

## How to Play

1. Start the Python program to initialize the game.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to take turns rolling the dice and deciding when to save your points.

3. Keep playing until one player reaches 51 points or more, and they are declared the winner.

4. Enjoy the game and have fun!

## Happy gaming!
